## Technical test
still a tech test before face to face interview. Finished under 24 hours. Don't know how to explain why some companies always say that your attitude is more important while the result is not. Appreciate it anyway. Keep learning & coding.
### How to start:
`npm install && react-native link`
- hint: the apis may expire in a few days. 
### Some dependencies
1.  Redux-persist  // persist refactored settings & loaded before start the app
2.  React-native-render-html // display html content with multiple props, better than WebView 
- There are some ways for navigating in React Native environment. Both React-Navigation and React-Native-Navigation are good solutions.
